'''
Series in Pandas is a one-dimensional array, like a column in a table. It is a labeled array that can hold data of any type. The Series() method is used for this and has the following parameters:

data: The data to be stored in the Pandas Series
index: The index values should have the same length as the data.
dtype: It is the datatype for the output Series.
name: Set the series name with the name parameter
copy: To copy the input data

#01
#Create a Pandas Series

import pandas as pd
data=[10,24,56,45,64,90]
result=pd.Series(data)
print(result)

#02
#Access a value from a Pandas Series
#Set the index of the value you want to display inside []:

import pandas as pd
data=[10,24,56,45,64,90]
result=pd.Series(data)
#print(result)
print( "\n\nserach a index value:",result[2])
print( "\n\nserach a index value:",result[0])


#03
#Name your own(custom) indexes in a Pandas Series
import pandas as pd
data=[10,24,56,45,64,90]
result=pd.Series(data,index=["r0","r1","r2","r3","r4","r5"])
print(result)

#04
#Access a value from a Pandas Series with labels
import pandas as pd
data=[10,24,56,45,64,90]
result=pd.Series(data,index=["r0","r1","r2","r3","r4","r5"])
print(result["r3"])
